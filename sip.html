<h3> Introduction </h3>
</div>
<h4>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</h3>
<p class="text">Composting is very valuable in the environment because it promotes cleanliness by using organic and natural compost instead of artificial fertilizer, and also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, like methane, which helps fight climate change. It is helpful for the community because it also promotes gardening to people, which supports local food production and enhances the community soil. </p>
<h4>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p class="text">Will cabbage and potato compost affect the growth of seedlings?
</p>
<h4>HYPOTHESIS</h4>
<p class="text">If cabbages and potatoes are used as compost, the pechay seedlings will grow faster.
</p>
<h4>REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</h4>
<p class="text">Composting is a process in which organic materials are used to give the needed nutrients to the soil, and provide good conditions for the plant to grow in. Nutrients such as potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen are essential for plant growth, which is why it must be present in the soil the plants will grow in. We picked potatoes and cabbage as our compost because they have these three nutrients that will help the pehchay plant grow with the needed from the soil.
